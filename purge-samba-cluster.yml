# This playbook purges samba 
# It removes: packages, configuration files and ALL THE DATA
#
# Use it like this:
# ansible-playbook purge-cluster.yml
#     Prompts for confirmation to purge, defaults to no and
#     doesn't purge the cluster. yes purges the cluster.
#
# ansible-playbook -e ireallymeanit=yes|no purge-cluster.yml
#     Overrides the prompt using -e option. Can be used in
#     automation scripts to avoid interactive prompt.
