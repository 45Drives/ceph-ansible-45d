# samba_repo can either be '45drives' or 'community'.
# Community will install Samba,CTDB & Winbind packages from the standard CentOS repo.
# 45drives will install the same packages and version of Samba,CTDB & Winbind as communuty but rebuilt with support for storing CTDB locks in RADOS objects.
# Default is to install with RADOS support. If not using samba with CephFS then "community" is fine.
